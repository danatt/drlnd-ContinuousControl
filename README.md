# drlnd-ContinuousControl

### Udacity RL-ContinuousControl Project

This is a project from the **Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree** @Udacity. 

_The task is to solve the Unity [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) Environment._
You can watch the final result by using the `watch_a_trained_agent.ipynb`.
